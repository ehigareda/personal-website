        <h4 class="work-box work-name1">Gitlet</h4>
        <ul class="work-box work-desc1">
          <li>- Implemented a version-control system from scratch using Java mimicking the
            basic features of the popular system Git, requiring a deep understanding of how
            version control systems operate, creating design documents describing an
            implementations strategy, and file serialization.</li>
          <li>- Uses include being able to save the contents of entire directories of files while
            tracking the history of the files to be able to restore prior versions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="work-box work-name2">Jump</h4>
        <ul class="work-box work-desc2">
          <li>- Created a two-person strategy board game using Java that allowed a user to play
            against a computer, against another person, and allowed the computer to play
            itself.</li>
          <li>- Implemented an AI program in the game that would reliably find a win from any
            position in which a win for the AI a certain number of rounds away by using a
            recursive minimax algorithm.  </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="work-box work-name4">LED Field Technician @ Learfield</h4>
        <ul class="work-box work-desc4">
          <li>- Developed easy-to-use macros which allowed for our team to screen batches
            onto the LED board interfaces more efficiently.</li>
          <li>- Worked technically with other teams to run nationally televised events at venues
            in a smooth and professional manner.</li>
          <li>- Contributed maintenance and repairs to LED boards at stadiums and sports
            venues, sometimes during live events.</li>
          <li>- Worked with a team to completely replace and revamp signage systems and LED
            displays at the California Memorial Stadium</li>
